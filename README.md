# Luxign (Lux Design) – AI-Powered Interior Design Platform

Luxign is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that transforms the way people approach room decoration using AI.

With Luxign, users can:

- Upload a photo of their room (living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.)

- Instantly receive a beautifully redesigned version of the room using advanced AI models

Luxign is designed for:

- Homeowners who want to redecorate or renovate
- Interior designers looking for quick mockups
- Real estate agents enhancing property visuals
- Furniture brands that want to showcase their products in different contexts

The goal of Luxign is to make interior design more accessible, faster, and visually intuitive — all powered by artificial intelligence.
